**Custom cables**

In the Altruist project we use custom cables to connect external sensors such as:
- BME280 temperature, humidity and pressure sensor
- noise sensor ICS-43434
- radiation sensor
- PM sensor SDS011

 Custom cables can be ordered at [LCSC.com](https://www.lcsc.com/customcables?utm_source=customcables&utm_medium=navbar)
When ordering cables, please attach a cable schematic to your order, LCSC experts will process your order and estimate the cost of cable fabrication.
