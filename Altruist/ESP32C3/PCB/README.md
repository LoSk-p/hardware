## Using Production Files for Ordering PCBs

You can use these production files to order PCBs independently. We have personally checked several manufacturing facilities, such as PCBWay, NextPCB, and [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), all of which can produce high-quality prototypes of your devices. However, at the moment, we prefer to manufacture our devices on JLCPCB's production facilities.


### [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) and [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com/) Integration

JLCPCB has its own PCB design environment called EasyEDA, which is free and allows users to design and order PCBs with components directly. EasyEDA is synchronized with LCSC's component inventory, making it easy to specify components during the design process. This integration simplifies the creation of assembly specifications and reduces errors.

## Making Changes to the Scheme or PCB

If you want to make changes to the scheme or PCB, visit the project's [homepage](https://oshwlab.com/ludovich88/altruist-rc-v0-1-1). There, you can copy the project and make your own [changes](https://pro.easyeda.com/editor#id=ae37b8359dab422b9a312163f5fd41ee) using the EasyEDA environment.

### Steps to Modify the Project:

1. **Access the Project Page**: Go to the project's page on OSHWLab.
2. **Copy the Project**: Use the option to copy the project to your own workspace.
3. **Open EasyEDA**: Navigate to the EasyEDA editor to make changes to the PCB design.
4. **Edit the Design**: Use EasyEDA's tools to modify the PCB layout or circuit scheme as needed.
5. **Save and Export**: Once changes are complete, save the project and export the updated design files for production.
